# Project_1_Rooming
This program assigns students/campers to rooms for overnight trips, with the constraint that each student/camper could request up to three roommates.

During my senior year of high school, I worked on an independent computer science project where I designed an algorithm to assign students to rooms for overnight school trips, with the constraint that each student could request up to three roommates. Unfortunately, I did not finish the project due to COVID-19, which put a halt to school trips. Recently, I took a new look at this project by applying the skills I gained in college, particularly from my data structures class.

As I resumed work on the project, I encountered some challenges. First, I realized that students with no mutual roommate requests, especially if their other requested roommates were already in different rooms, needed special attention. Additionally, I understood that the algorithm's primary goal should not only be efficiency but also the emotional well-being of students, considering how common social anxiety is among high school students. This led me to rethink the idea of letting a computer handle all room assignments without any human input.

I came to the conclusion that a collaborative approach, where the computer initially assigned rooms based on its algorithm, followed by human users reviewing the rooms based on their knowledge of school dynamics, was the most suitable solution. This approach would be especially helpful for identifying and supporting vulnerable students who lacked roommate requests or mutual requests, ultimately highlighting the important balance between computer algorithms and human judgment in addressing complex issues like student well-being in a school setting. Therefore, the program output is not a complete list of rooms. Instead, the computer assigns as many students as possibe to rooms and those who are unassigned are sent back to the human user to place in an open spot.

The program returns all the important information into an excel sheet.
